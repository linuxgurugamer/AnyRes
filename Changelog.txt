ChangeLog

2.0.11
	Reverted back to 2.0.9.1
	The following change was inspired by the mod Resolution Keeper, published by Spacedock user Bion:
		Added check to verify that the resolution hadn't changed outside of the game, and reset it if it has
	Updated version file to use github for new version info

2.0.10.1
	Updated README
	Updated version file to use github for new version info

2.0.10
	Thanks to github user @KerballOne for this:
		Added Features UI Scale setting and set per SCENE
		It can now automatically switch resolution and UI scale based on scene. Each setting config now includes
			a "scale" attribute in addition to name, height, width and fullscreen.
		All it needs is a config file (auto created on first run) with the scene name (e.g. 'EDITOR', 
			'FLIGHT', etc.).
		The UI Window updates after each action and allows to save by preset or SCENE. So saving and/or apply new presets is easier.
